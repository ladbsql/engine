# üêç LADB (SQL)

It is an experiment where I create a database engine to learn how it works in depth, if you want to see more information about my projects you can do it in my portfolio [click here](https://damkan.lat).

## üëæ How Works

I was looking for ways to make a database and most of them were with C, C++, Etc.

And I would like to deliver something to the community made with Python, it is possible that it already exists but in addition to create it I would like to learn how the databases work from behind or assimilate the behavior of this to a real one and SQL, so the plan is to make it work to an own extension that is `.ldb` and also that you can make a **CRUD** of the tables from a `CLI`.

Also to integrate an encryption to the `.ldb` files since they are based on JSON and its content is very easy to read, to be able to load your own `.ldb` and create them as well.

Besides of course you can host **LaDB** on a server and make requests.
